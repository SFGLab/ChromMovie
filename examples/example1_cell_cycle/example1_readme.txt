The data used in this example comes from the following study:
Haoxi Chai et al., Tri-omic mapping revealed concerted dynamics of 3D epigenome and transcriptome in brain cells
bioRxiv 2024.05.03.592322; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.03.592322 

The cell line is k562. The contacts were collected and aggregated into metacells (for details see the study).
Here, metacells G1_0, S_0, S_25, G2M_10 and G2M_30 in this order were used. 
The contacts were filtered for the intra-chromosomal contacts of chr1 and subsampled to 1,000 contacts each.

Please, use the following parameters when running ChromMovie on this example:
