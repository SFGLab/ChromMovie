The data used in this example comes from the following study:
Haoxi Chai et al., Tri-omic mapping revealed concerted dynamics of 3D epigenome and transcriptome in brain cells
bioRxiv 2024.05.03.592322; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.03.592322 

The cell line is mouse vascular. The contacts were collected for postnatal days 2 (P2), 11 (P11), 95 (P95), 365 (P365, 1-year), and 730 (P730, 2-year) (for details see the study).
The contacts were filtered for the intra-chromosomal contacts of chr3 and subsampled to 1,000 contacts each.

Please, use the following parameters when running ChromMovie on this example:
